Why is version / source control important?
  version/ source control allow users such as developer 
to collaborate with one another on projects with up to date
changes by others. On another note, different versions of 
projects have neatly stored so that user can easily compare
and contrast changes made. It is stored or backup all the
information for everyone to access remotely from anywhere.
With version control, projects stay organize and up to date
changes available for everyone on the collaboration team.
